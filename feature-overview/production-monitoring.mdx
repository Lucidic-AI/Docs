# Production Monitoring

**Production Monitoring** enables you to track and analyze your AI agents' performance in real-world production environments, providing critical insights into cost, reliability, and user experience.

Instead of flying blind in production, you get **comprehensive visibility** into how your agents perform with real users and data.

---

## Why Use Production Monitoring?

**Production is different from development** — real users, real data, real stakes.

Production Monitoring helps you:

* Track costs and resource usage in real-time
* Identify and diagnose production errors quickly
* Monitor performance degradation before users complain
* Establish baselines for normal behavior
* Detect anomalies and unusual patterns
* Prove ROI with detailed cost analytics

### Use Cases

* **Cost Management**: Track token usage and API costs per session
* **Error Tracking**: Catch and diagnose failures before they impact users
* **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure response times meet SLAs
* **Capacity Planning**: Understand usage patterns and scale appropriately
* **Compliance**: Audit agent behavior for safety and policy adherence

## Enabling Production Monitoring

### In Your Code

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
```python
from lucidicai import LucidicAI

client = LucidicAI(api_key="...", providers=["openai"])

# Enable production monitoring for this session
with client.sessions.create(
    session_name="prod_user_support",
    production_monitoring=True
):
    # Your agent logic
    result = run_agent()
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
import { LucidicAI } from 'lucidicai';

const client = new LucidicAI({ apiKey: '...', providers: ['openai'] });

await client.sessions.create({
    sessionName: 'prod_user_support',
    productionMonitoring: true
});

// Your agent logic
const result = await runAgent();

await client.sessions.end();
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also set it via environment variable:

```bash
export LUCIDIC_PRODUCTION_MONITORING=true
```

### In the Dashboard

Navigate to your agent and click the **"Production"** tab to access the monitoring dashboard.

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Overview Metrics

The top of the dashboard displays real-time KPIs:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/production-metrics.png" alt="Production metrics cards showing sessions, costs, tokens, and errors" />
</Frame>

* **Total Sessions**: Count of production sessions in selected timeframe
* **Average Duration**: Mean session execution time
* **Total Cost**: Aggregate spend across all sessions

### Cost Analysis

Track and optimize your AI spending:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/production-cost-chart.png" alt="Cost trend chart showing daily spending and projections" />
</Frame>

**Cost Breakdown Views**:
- **By Time**: 1 day, 3 day, 1 week, 2 week, and 1 month metrics
- **By Percentiles**: Median, 90th percentile, and 99th percentile cost breakdown

**Cost Optimization Insights**:
- Identify expensive outlier sessions
- Find opportunities to use cheaper models
- Click into sessions that cost too much

### Error Monitoring

Proactively catch and fix production issues in the errors tab:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/production-errors.png" alt="Error tracking interface showing error types and affected sessions" />
</Frame>

**Error Tracking Features**:
- **Error Types**: Categorized by type (timeout, API, validation)
- **Error Messages**: Full error details and stack traces
- **Affected Sessions**: Direct links to problematic sessions

### Latency Monitoring

Monitor time taken for each session to catch outliers:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/production-latency.png" alt="Latency tracking interface" />
</Frame>

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- **Response Time Distribution**: P50, P95, P99 latencies
- **Event Duration**: Time spent in each workflow event

## Session Deep Dives

Click any session from the monitoring dashboard to investigate:

**Session Details Include**:
- Complete execution timeline
- All LLM calls with prompts/responses
- Token usage per call
- Cost breakdown
- Error details and stack traces
- Performance waterfall chart

**Investigation Tools**:
- [Time Travel](/feature-overview/time-travel) to replay sessions
- Export session data for offline analysis

## Best Practices

### Production Monitoring Setup

**Start Small**
- Enable for a subset of users first
- Gradually increase monitoring coverage
- Validate data accuracy

**Tag Everything**
```python
with client.sessions.create(
    session_name=f"support_chat_{user_id}",
    production_monitoring=True,
    tags=["user_tier:premium", "feature:chat", "version:2.1.0"]
):
    # Your agent logic
    ...
```

### Cost Optimization

**Monitor Regularly**
- Daily cost reviews during rollout
- Weekly trending analysis
- Monthly budget reconciliation

**Optimize Strategically**
- Identify most expensive operations
- Consider model downgrades where appropriate
- Cache repeated operations
- Batch similar requests

### Error Management

**Categorize Errors**
- User errors vs system errors
- Recoverable vs fatal
- Expected vs unexpected

**Track Resolution**
- Time to detection
- Time to resolution
- Recurrence prevention

## Integration with Other Features

### With Experiments

Compare production performance to experiments:
```python
# Run experiment
with client.sessions.create(
    session_name="Test Variant",
    experiment_id="exp_new_model"
):
    # Test new approach
    ...

# Compare to production baseline in dashboard
```

### With Rubrics

Apply evaluation rubrics to production sessions:
```python
with client.sessions.create(
    session_name="Production Task",
    production_monitoring=True,
    rubrics=["Customer Satisfaction", "Response Quality"]
):
    # Your agent logic
    ...
```

Monitor rubric scores across production traffic to ensure quality.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sessions not appearing in production view**
- Verify `production_monitoring=True` is set
- Check session has completed
- Refresh the dashboard
- Ensure correct time range selected

**High costs unexpectedly**
- Review error retry logic
- Check for infinite loops
- Audit model selection
- Review prompt templates
