title: Workflow Sandbox
description: Dive into a full breakdown of one agent run — replay, inspect, evaluate, and debug every decision.
---

# 🧪 Workflow Sandbox

The **Workflow Sandbox** is your deep-dive view into a single agent run — also known as a [Session](/sessions).

It’s where observability meets usability: you can **replay the session**, **inspect every step**, **explore the underlying events**, and **evaluate performance** using rubrics — all in one place.

---

## 🧠 What It Shows

At the top of the Workflow Sandbox, you’ll see:

### 1. 📝 Task Overview
- The task string supplied to the agent at the start of the session

### 2. 📊 Session Stats
- Completion status
- Time taken
- Step count
- Cost
- Eval score (from [Rubrics](/features/rubrics) or [default Lucidic scoring](/sessions#default-evaluation))

> 📷 _**[Insert screenshot of task and overview panel with stats + Lucidic score]**_

---

## 🧮 Rubric Evaluations

Below the overview, you’ll find any evaluation rubrics attached to this session.

- Each criterion is scored and explained
- The **Lucidic default rubric** runs on every session automatically
- Custom rubrics can be attached per Agent or manually in post-analysis

---

## 🎬 Session Replay

Replay the agent’s full run using:

- A **GIF or video** of the session
- Step-by-step visualization
- Optional LLM call preview

This gives you a literal frame-by-frame look at how the agent behaved.

---

## 📚 Quick Access: Prompt DB

You can open the [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db) directly from the session:

- Quickly view which prompt was used
- Test changes or view version history
- Future: See prompt lineage and performance impact

> 📷 _**[Insert screenshot of Prompt DB modal or access link]**_

---

## 🧭 Step Trajectory Graph

Next, you’ll see a **Session-specific graph** — a mini version of the [Workflow Trajectory](/features/workflow-trajectory), scoped to just this one session.

- **Nodes** = states visited
- **Edges** = actions taken
- **Grouped** = similar states are clustered (e.g. looping or retrying)

Clicking a node opens a full breakdown of that **Step** below the graph.

## 🕰 Timeline Navigation

Two synced timelines appear below:

### 🪜 Step Timeline
- Shows the ordered sequence of Steps
- Clicking a step:
  - Advances the graph to that state
  - Opens the step detail panel

### ⚙️ Event Timeline (within Step)
- Shows all [Events](/events) that occurred in that step (e.g. LLM calls, tool invocations)
- Clicking an event shows:
  - Request/response
  - Cost
  - Model used
  - Any errors or retries

> 📷 _**[Insert split-view image of step + event timeline interaction]**_

## 🧰 Use Cases

The Workflow Sandbox is where you:

- Debug a failed run
- Investigate edge cases
- Replay odd behavior
- Evaluate agent consistency
- Identify root causes of errors
- Understand how a prompt or model change affected logic

---

## 🔮 Future Features

- Annotate steps or events
- Inline prompt diffing
- Add “Time Travel” from any step to re-try logic with modified prompts
- Attach notes to runs for team reviews or QA
