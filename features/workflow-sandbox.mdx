title:  Viewing Sessions (Workflow Sandbox)
description: Dive into a full breakdown of one agent run — replay, inspect, evaluate, and debug every decision.

#  Workflow Sandbox

The **Workflow Sandbox** is your deep-dive view into a single agent run — also known as a [Session](/core-concepts/sessions). Learn to create a session with our [Quick Start guide](/getting-started/quickstart).

This is where observability meets usability: you can **replay the session**, **inspect every step**, **explore the underlying events**, and **evaluate performance** using rubrics — all in one place.

> To get here Click **Project -> Agent -> any session in the session history**.

## Trace view

The Trace View shows a comprehensive timeline of your agent run. It includes all steps and events in sequential order.

It shows:
 - Basic Information: **Status, Model, Start Time, Duration, Cost**
 - **Prettified vs Raw Request/Response** (click the wand/text icon in the top right of Input/Output to toggle)
 - **Screenshots** and multimodal data

> **Pro tip:** **SPEED UP** iteration and debugging time by avoiding rerunning the same failed run with [Time Travels](/features/time-travel). They enable you to freeze time and rerun the event in isolation to see if your error/success is reliable.

## Session Evaluations

On this tab, you’ll find any evaluations ran on this session. Read more about evaluation rubrics [here](/features/rubrics).

- Each criterion is scored and explained
- Custom rubrics can be attached per Agent when running a session
- You can pass in your own evals at runtime to be shown here too

## Prompt DB

You can open the [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db) directly by clicking on the tab:

- Quickly view which prompt was used
- Test changes or view version history
- Add tags to quickly iterate on prompts

---
## Session Replay: Step Trajectory Graph

Next, you’ll see a **Session-specific graph** — a mini version of the [Workflow Trajectory](/features/workflow-trajectory), scoped to just this one session.

- **Nodes:** states visited
- **Edges:** actions taken
- **Grouped:** similar states are clustered (e.g. looping or retrying)

> **Pro tip:** The step which caused your agent to fail will be highlighted in red! Hover over the error icon in the top right of the node to quickly see a failure explanation.

> **Note:** If you want to turn off error highlighting, click the alarm icon in the bottom left toolbar of the graph.

> **Pro tip:** Clicking a **Step/Event** opens a full breakdown of that **Step/Event** below the graph!

## Use Cases

The Workflow Sandbox is where you:

- **Debug** a failed run
- **Investigate** edge cases
- **Replay** odd behavior
- **Evaluate** agent consistency
- **Identify** root causes of errors
- **Understand** how a prompt or model change affected logic
