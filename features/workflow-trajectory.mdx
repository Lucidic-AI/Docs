# Workflow Trajectory

The **Workflow Trajectory** graph is a core visualization in every [Mass Simulation](/mass-simulations). It merges all agent behavior across multiple Sessions into a single, clustered graph — giving you a bird’s-eye view of the **decision space** your agent explores.

It reveals not just **what happened**, but what **could happen** — and how often.

---

## What It Shows

Each **node** in the Workflow Trajectory represents a **grouped state** the agent reached (e.g., same web page, same state string, or same screenshot).

Each **edge** represents a **transition** (an action) the agent took between states.

## Interacting with the Graph

- **Orange edges** are **forward** transitions — the agent moved forward to a new state
- **Blue edges** are **backward** transitions — the agent moved back to a previous state
- **Pink edges** are **self** transitions — the agent went back to the same state
- **The multiplier** shows the frequency of that transition across all sessions (i.e. how many sessions took that transition)

- **Click into a node** to inspect all sessions that passed through that state

- **Scroll down** to use the [Time Travel](/features/time-travel) feature to see how likely it is that your agent will make a specific action with **different parameters** (prompt, model, temperature, etc.).

## How It's Built

1. **Each Session** has its own step-wise graph of states and transitions
2. **As Sessions run**, they’re incrementally merged into the **Mass Simulation's Workflow Trajectory**
3. **Steps** from different sessions are **clustered** if they match by state
4. Transitions between these clustered states are recorded with **frequency counts**

```text
Session 1: A → B → C
Session 2: A → B → D

Workflow Trajectory:
A
├── B
│   ├── C (50%)
│   └── D (50%)
```

## Why It Matters

This graph helps you answer critical questions:

- What are the most **common trajectories** the agent follows?
- Where does the agent **branch** or act inconsistently?
- Are there **failure-prone paths** that show up repeatedly?
- Do sessions **loop**, revisit states, or get stuck?

By visualizing all possible paths, you gain a statistical view of your agent's decision-making.

<Callout type="warning">
If a task is supposed to be deterministic, any branching in this graph reveals instability in your agent’s behavior.
</Callout>

## Probabilistic Insights

You can think of this graph as a **probabilistic model** of your agent’s behavior:

- It reveals which transitions are **dominant** and which are **rare**
- It helps you estimate **failure rates** in certain trajectories
- It surfaces **unexpected branches** and **edge cases**
