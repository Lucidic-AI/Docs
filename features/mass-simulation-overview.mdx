# 📊 Mass Simulations

**Mass Simulations** give you a breakdown of your agent's behavior over multiple runs. They merge data from dozens or hundreds of sessions to reveal patterns, inconsistencies, and performance metrics at scale.

Running an agent workflow once is not enough to understand how it behaves. Agents are non-deterministic and need to be run multiple times to understand their behavior.

This is your tool for:
* **Uncovering hidden failure patterns** - Surface recurring agent missteps and edge cases that aren't obvious in a single run
* **Measuring reliability and consistency** - Track evaluation metrics like task completion rate, action precision, and failure frequency
* **Identifying regressions or improvements** - Compare performance across model versions, prompt changes, or code adjustments
* **Visualizing agent behavior at scale** - Explore aggregated session trajectories and failure categories

Mass Simulations are essential for robust agent development. They help you move from **"it works once"** to **"it works reliably."**
