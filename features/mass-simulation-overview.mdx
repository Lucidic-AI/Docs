# 📊 Mass Simulations

**Mass Simulations** give you a breakdown of your agent's behavior over multiple runs. They merge data from dozens or hundreds of sessions to reveal patterns, inconsistencies, and performance metrics at scale.

**Running an agent workflow once is not enough to understand how it behaves.** Agents are non-deterministic and need to be run multiple times to understand their behavior.

This is your tool for:
* **Uncovering hidden failure patterns** - Surface recurring agent missteps and edge cases that aren't obvious in a single run
* **Measuring reliability and consistency** - Track evaluation metrics like task completion rate, action precision, and failure frequency
* **Identifying regressions or improvements** - Compare performance across model versions, prompt changes, or code adjustments
* **Visualizing agent behavior at scale** - Explore aggregated session trajectories and failure categories

Mass Simulations are essential for robust agent development. They help you move from **"it works once"** to **"it works reliably."**

## 🔍 Exploring Mass Simulation Analytics

### Getting Started

1. **Head to the session history page and click on the mass simulations tab**
> 📷 _![mass simulation tab](/images/msa0.7.png)_

1.5 [Optional]. Filter by any tags you added to the session (learn more about creating tags [here](/getting-started/masssim#2-create-in-python-sdk))

> 📷 _<img src="/images/msa1.5.2.png" alt="mass simulation tab" width="500" />_
This is useful if you want to quickly analyze a subset of mass simulations.
