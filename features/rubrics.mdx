# 📏 Rubrics

**Rubrics** let you define structured evaluation criteria for your agents — turning your domain knowledge into consistent, explainable scoring systems.

Instead of relying on a single pass/fail outcome or ad hoc scores, rubrics help you **quantify agent quality** across dimensions you care about.

---

## 🧠 Why Use Rubrics?

Agents don’t just succeed or fail — they:

- Take longer or shorter paths
- Repeat actions
- Visit the wrong pages
- Succeed inconsistently

Rubrics let you **capture those nuances** and **standardize how you evaluate** an agent’s session. They’re perfect for comparing sessions, identifying regressions, or measuring improvement across prompt or model changes.

## 🧬 Rubric Anatomy

A rubric contains:

- One or more **Criteria**
- Optional **weights** for each criterion
- **Score Definitions** (what a score of 1 or 10 means for each criterion)

### Example

```yaml
Rubric: "Browser Navigation Quality"

Criteria:
  - name: "Revisiting Sites"
    weight: 2
    scores:
      10: "Never visited a site more than once"
      5: "Occasionally revisited"
      1: "Frequently revisited the same sites"

  - name: "Step Efficiency"
    weight: 1
    scores:
      10: "Completed task in under 10 steps"
      5: "11–15 steps"
      1: "More than 15 steps"
```

## 📊 Scoring and Weights

Each criterion is scored independently (typically from 1–10) and then combined into a **composite score**:

- If no weights are defined, all criteria are weighted equally
- If weights are set, we compute a **weighted average** using their relative values

## ⚙️ Defining and Applying Rubrics

### In the UI

- Navigate to the **Rubrics** tab on any Agent
- Create, name, and configure a rubric
- Attach it to Sessions manually or automatically

### In Python (optional)

```python
session.log_eval(rubric="browser_navigation_quality")
```

You can apply rubrics at runtime or in post-processing via the dashboard.

## 🧪 Comparing Sessions with Rubrics

Rubrics allow you to:

- Compare sessions side-by-side by **dimension**
- Track **regressions** after changing a prompt or model
- Evaluate agents across **Mass Simulations** in a structured way

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **You** decide what matters
- **We** provide the structure to score it consistently
- Rubrics let teams align on shared definitions of "good agent behavior"

<Callout type="info">
Rubrics are reusable, attach to Agents, and can be applied to any Session — now or later.
</Callout>
