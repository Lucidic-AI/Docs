title: SDK Installation
description: The Lucidic AI SDK lets you record, evaluate, and debug your AI agents by connecting them to the Lucidic platform.

---
> **Note:** Setup has three parts — (1) installing the SDK (below), (2) connecting it to the Lucidic [dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard), and (3) [setting up steps, events, and sessions](/getting-started/final-instructions). You need to complete all three.

## Install the SDK

Our package is published on PyPI under the name `lucidicai`.

```bash
pip install lucidicai
```

We recommend installing it into a virtual environment or as part of your existing agent stack.

---

## Minimum Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- Compatible with all major LLM frameworks and agent libraries
- Works in local, server, or cloud environments

---

## Next Step: Connect to the Dashboard

Once installed, head to the [Dashboard guide](/getting-started/dashboard) to connect your SDK to your Lucidic workspace.
