title: SDK Installation
description: The Lucidic AI SDK lets you record, evaluate, and debug your AI agents by connecting them to the Lucidic platform.

---
> 🧠 **Note:** Setup has two parts — (1) installing the SDK (below) and (2) connecting it to the Lucidic [dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard). You need to complete both.

## 📦 Install the SDK

Our package is published on PyPI under the name `lucidicai`.

```bash
pip install lucidicai
```

We recommend installing it into a virtual environment or as part of your existing agent stack.

---

## 🧪 Minimum Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- Compatible with all major LLM frameworks and agent libraries
- Works in local, server, or cloud environments

---

## 🌐 Next Step: Connect to the Dashboard

Once installed, head to the [Dashboard guide](/getting-started/dashboard) to connect your SDK to your Lucidic workspace.
