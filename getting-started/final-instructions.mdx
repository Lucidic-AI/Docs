title: Code Setup (Part 2)
description: Learn how to install LucidicAI and set up Steps, Events, and Sessions.
---

> üß† **Note:** Setup has two parts ‚Äî (1) connecting it to the [Lucidic Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard), and (2) [installing LucidicAI and setting up steps, events, and sessions in your code](/getting-started/final-instructions) (below).

## üì¶ Install the SDK

Our package is published on PyPI under the name `lucidicai`.

```bash
pip install lucidicai
```

We recommend installing it into a **virtual environment** or as part of your existing agent stack.

### üß™ Minimum Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- Compatible with all major LLM frameworks and agent libraries
- Works in local, server, or cloud environments

---

# üêç Using the Python SDK

Once you've [installed Lucidic](/getting-started/final-instructions#üì¶-install-the-sdk) and [connected it to the dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard), you're ready to start recording your agent's behavior, step by step.

This guide walks you through how to initialize a session, track steps and events, and optionally pull prompts from our [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db).

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Create a Session

Creating a session requires the `init` function to be called on the `lai` object: `lai.init()`. The initialization is parameterized by the following:

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session_name`  | `str`  | A name for your session ‚Äì whatever you want (e.g. `"Search Wikipedia"`)     |
| `providers`     | `list[str]`  | List of LLM providers to track ‚Äì `["openai"]`, `["anthropic"]`, `["langchain"]`, `["pydantic_ai"]`, `["openai_agents"]` |
| `lucidic_api_key` | `str` (optional IF set as environment variable) | Your Lucidic API key ‚Äì you should have this copied somewhere safe           |
| `agent_id`      | `str` (optional IF set as environment variable) | Your Lucidic Agent ID ‚Äì you can get this from the dashboard                 |
| `task`          | `str` (optional)  | The task your agent is performing. **Must** be specified to show up on the dashboard (e.g. `"Search Wikipedia for Steve Jobs biography"`) |
| `mass_sim_id`   | `str` (optional)  | The mass simulation ID your agent is part of (e.g. `"8021bc11-20f3-48cb-8717-6ef9017e3663"`) |
| `rubrics`       | `list[str]` (optional)  | The rubrics you want to use for evaluation (e.g. `["default", "custom_score"]`) |
| `tags` | `list[str]` (optional) | A list of tags to categorize this session. |

### 1) If you **DO NOT** have your Lucidic API Key and Lucidic Agent ID in a .env file.

You must provide the `lucidic_api_key`, `agent_id`, and `providers` parameters to either `lai.init()` or set them as environment variables. The `session_name` is optional but recommended. 

Full version of init:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
lai.init(
    session_name="Search Wikipedia",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",   
    agent_id="your-agent-id",         
    providers=["openai"], # "openai", "anthropic", if "langchain" you can leave this blank checkout [LangChain Integration](/integrations/langchain)
    # Optional fields
    task="Search Wikipedia for Steve Jobs biography",
    mass_sim_id="your-mass-sim-id",   
    rubrics=["default", "custom_score"]
)
```

We **recommend** moving the `LUCIDIC_API_KEY` and `LUCIDIC_AGENT_ID` to environment variables. The way to do this is create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following. Most of you will already have a .env (it is where you would keep any API key) and will just have to add a Lucidic API Key and a Lucidic Agent ID.
```python
LUCIDIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
LUCIDIC_AGENT_ID="your-agent-id"
```
OR 
You can set the environment variables in your terminal:
```bash
export LUCIDIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
export LUCIDIC_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id
```

### 2) If you **DO** have your Lucidic API Key and Lucidic Agent ID in a .env file.

You will just need the `providers` parameter. The `session_name` is optional but recommended.

```python
import lucidicai as lai
lai.init(
    session_name="Search Wikipedia",
    providers=["openai"],
    # Optional fields
    task="Search Wikipedia for Steve Jobs biography",
    mass_sim_id="your-mass-sim-id",   
    rubrics=["default", "custom_score"]          
)
```

---

## üß≠ Step 2: Create Steps

Each step should represent a meaningful action or decision point. 

Use `lai.create_step()` and `lai.end_step()` around your step logic. `lai.create_step()` creates a step and allows you to attach information to that step. `lai.end_step()` ends the step and optionally allows you to either adjust or add information to the created step. 

`lai.create_step()` and `lai.end_step()` are both parameterized by the following. All fields are optional, but we recommend setting as many of them as possible to improve debugging, evaluation, and traceability.

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `state`         | `str` (optional)  | A short description of the current environment or UI (e.g., page title, visible content, or system state). |
| `action`        | `str` (optional)  | What the agent did in this step (e.g., ‚Äúclicked submit‚Äù, ‚Äúfilled out form‚Äù). |
| `goal`          | `str` (optional)  | What the agent *intended* to accomplish (e.g., ‚Äúnavigate to checkout‚Äù, ‚Äúextract user name‚Äù). |
| `screenshot_path` | `str` (optional)  | Path to a screenshot file for visual context. |
| `screenshot`    | `str` (optional)  | Base64-encoded screenshot image for visual context. |
| `eval_score`    | `float` (optional)  | A step-level rating (e.g. `5`) to assess performance at that point. |
| `eval_description` | `str` (optional) | An explanation justifying the `eval_score` on why your agent performed well or poorly (e.g. "Agent performed well because it successfully extracted the username"). |

You can pass in information into `lai.end_step` if any information has changed since `lai.create_step` was called (but this is not necessary, you can just call `lai.end_step()`). 

```python
lai.create_step(
    state="Home page", 
    action="Navigating to search",
    goal="Navigate to search",
    screenshot_path="/path/to/screenshot.png",
    eval_score=5,
    eval_description="Agent successfully navigated to search page",
) # All fields are optional

# Your agent logic here...

# All fields will be overwritten if they are provided in end_step
lai.end_step(
    action="Clicked search",
    eval_score=4,
    eval_description="Agent successfully clicked search",
)
```

> Only **one step can be active at a time**, so be sure to end a step before creating a new one.

### üéØ Automatic Step Creation

If you're using a supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, PydanticAI) and make an LLM call without an active step, Lucidic will **automatically create one for you**:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from openai import OpenAI

lai.init(providers=["openai"])

client = OpenAI()

# No step created yet, but this still works!
# Lucidic auto-creates a step when the LLM call happens
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

# The auto-created step will be ended when the session ends
```

This ensures you never lose tracking data, even if you forget to create steps explicitly.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è (Optional) Step Updates

You can update the current step mid-run using `lai.update_step()`. 

The parameters are the exact same as `lai.create_step`. You would use this if you want to add/adjust any information after a step has been created.

```python
lai.create_step(
    ...
)

...

lai.update_step(
    state="Updated state",
    action="Updated action",
    goal="Updated goal",
    eval_score=5,
    eval_description="Updated eval description",
    # Use either screenshot OR screenshot_path, not both
    screenshot_path="/path/to/image.png"
)

...

lai.end_step(
    ...
)
```

---

## üéóÔ∏è Step 3: Create Events

If your agent has tool calls or LLM usage, track them as **events** within each step. 
> If you only have LLM calls with a supported provider you don't need to create events for them! Lucidic will automatically create events for you. For instance, if you set `provider="openai"` in `lai.init()`, Lucidic will automatically create events for you for any OpenAI calls.


`lai.create_event` and `lai.end_event` are both parameterized by the following. All of these parameters are optional, but we recommend **setting as many as possible** to improve debugging, evaluation, and traceability. 

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `description`   | `str` (optional)  | A detailed explanation of the event (e.g., ‚Äúclicked submit‚Äù, ‚Äúcompleted form entry‚Äù), or any relevant input, context, or memory for your agent. This field is often used to capture user actions, LLM prompts, document processing inputs, or data retrieval details. Include any information you consider important for your agent. |
| `result`        | `str` (optional)  | This is more of a result/output of the event. For example, if you are doing a document processing, this could be the result of the document processing. Or if you make an API call, this could be the result of the API call. |
| `model`         | `str` (optional)  | A lot of people use events with LLMs so if you have a custom LLM call you can set the model name here. |
| `cost_added`    | `float` (optional)  | Add the cost of the event here. |
| `screenshots`   | `list[str]` (optional) | Add a list of screenshots of the event here. Each screenshot should be provided as a file path or as base64-encoded image data. |

You can pass in information into `lai.end_event` if any information has changed since `lai.create_event` was called (but this is not necessary, you can just call `lai.end_event()`).

> **Note:** All fields will be overwritten EXCEPT for screenshots and cost_added which are appended/added.

```python
lai.create_event(
    description="OpenAI call",
    result="Summary generated",
    model="gpt-4o",
    cost_added=0.01,
    screenshots=["/path/to/screenshot.png"]
)
# Do your LLM call...

# All fields will be overwritten EXCEPT for screenshots and cost_added which are appended/added
lai.end_event(cost_added=0.01, screenshots=["/path/to/screenshot1.png", "/path/to/screenshot2.png"]) 
```

> **Reminder:** LLM calls from supported providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are **automatically captured** into events when you set the `providers` parameter in `init()`.

---

## üßº Step 4: End the Session

### üéØ Automatic Step Ending

When your session ends (either manually or automatically), Lucidic will **automatically end any active steps** for you. This means:

- You don't need to worry about forgetting to call `lai.end_step()`
- All steps are properly closed before the session completes
- Your data remains consistent even if your script exits unexpectedly

```python
lai.create_step(state="Processing", goal="Analyze data")
# Do some work...
# Oops, forgot to end the step!

# No problem - when session ends, the step is auto-ended
lai.end_session()  # Or let it auto-end on script exit
```

### üéØ Automatic Session Ending

Your session will automatically end when the script exits (via an `atexit` handler), but you can also end it manually with `lai.end_session` if you would like to add in evals:

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `is_successful` | `bool` (optional) | Whether the session was successful or not. |
| `is_successful_reason` | `str` (optional) | A short description of why the session was successful or not. |
| `session_eval` | `float` (optional) | A session-level rating (e.g. `5`) to assess performance at that point. |
| `session_eval_reason` | `str` (optional) | An explanation justifying the `session_eval` on why your agent performed well or poorly. |

```python
lai.end_session(
    is_successful=True,
    is_successful_reason="Completed all steps",
    session_eval=5,
    session_eval_reason="Accurate and efficient"
)
```

**All fields are optional ‚Äî if you don't provide them, Lucidic will automatically evaluate the session for you.**

### üöÄ How Auto-End Works

The `atexit` handler ensures your session data is always captured:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from openai import OpenAI

lai.init(providers=["openai"])

client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

# Script ends here - no explicit end_session() needed!
# Lucidic automatically:
# 1. Ends any active steps
# 2. Ends the session
# 3. Sends all data to the dashboard
```

This means you can instrument existing scripts with just 2 lines of code!

### üìä Additional Information: Custom Evaluation Rubrics

When ending a session, you can provide your own evaluation metrics to better assess your agent's performance:

- If you don't provide evaluation metrics, Lucidic will automatically evaluate your session using default rubrics.
- If you provide custom evaluation metrics, Lucidic will use your metrics instead of the default ones.

```python
# When ending the session, provide your custom evaluation
custom_evaluation, custom_evaluation_reason = custom_evaluation(...)

lai.end_session(
    is_successful=True,
    session_eval=custom_evaluation,
    session_eval_reason=custom_evaluation_reason
)
``` 

We recommend creating your own rubric for custom tasks to ensure the evaluation aligns with your specific requirements:

```python
# When initializing your session, specify custom rubrics
lai.init(
    session_name="custom_task",
    providers=["openai", "anthropic"],
    rubrics=["default", "my_custom_rubric"]  # Include both default and custom rubrics
)
```

Custom rubrics allow you to:
- Define task-specific success criteria
- Implement domain-specific evaluation metrics
- Compare agent performance across different versions using consistent metrics
- Track improvements over time with metrics tailored to your use case

Learn more about creating and using custom rubrics in the [Evaluation Rubrics](/features/rubrics) documentation.

---

### üß† Why Both `is_successful` and `session_eval`?

We support two types of evaluations so you can keep things simple or add more detail:

* `is_successful`: A binary flag ‚Äî did the agent complete the task?
* `session_eval`: A more detailed score (e.g. 1‚Äì5) showing *how well* the agent did.

If you only want to pass in one value (like a numeric score), you can compute the other yourself:

```python
score = 5
lai.end_session(
    is_successful=score >= 4,
    session_eval=str(score),
)
```

This gives you full control and lets you keep your logic consistent with your own success criteria.

---

## üì• Step 5: (Optional) Pull Prompts from Prompt DB

Use Lucidic‚Äôs [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db) so you never have to go to your code to make a prompt change again! See [here](/features/prompt-db) for more details.

Pull prompts from our prompt database in your code, change the content in the dashboard, and see them automatically update on your next agent run! We support prompt versioning and labels so you can have different versions of a prompt for different use cases (e.g. production, testing, etc.).

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prompt_name`   | `str`  | The name of the prompt to fetch.                                            |
| `label`         | `str` (optional)  | The label of the prompt to fetch. Defaults to `production`.                 |
| `variables`     | `dict` (optional) | A dictionary of string key/values to interpolate into the prompt.          |
| `cache_ttl`     | `int` (optional)  | The time-to-live for the prompt in seconds. Defaults to 300 seconds (0 = no cache, -1 = cache forever, n = cache for n seconds).         |

> **Note:** `cache_ttl` is only relevant if you are going to change your prompts during an ongoing session. All prompts are fetched at the beginning of a session. The `cache_ttl` determines how long the prompt will be cached for (i.e. if you set `cache_ttl=60`, the prompt will be cached for 60 seconds and if you make a change during this time, it will not be fetched until the `cache_ttl` expires).

```python
prompt = lai.get_prompt(
    prompt_name="summarize_webpage",
    variables={"page_text": "Stanford University is..."},
    label="production",
    cache_ttl=60
)
```

Additional notes:

- `{{variable}}` placeholders will be replaced using your dictionary
- Missing keys will raise an error
- Unreplaced variables will trigger a warning
- Read more at [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db)

## üß™ Full Session Code Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai

lai.init(
    session_name="wiki_search",
    agent_id="agent-123",
    providers=["openai"],
    task="Search for Stanford University",
    rubrics=["default"]
)

lai.create_step(state="Home", goal="Search for Stanford")

# (Your logic here)

# EVENT 1
lai.create_event(description="OpenAI call")
# (Your LLM call)
lai.end_event(result="Went to Wikipedia") # Optional 

# EVENT 2
lai.create_event(description="OpenAI call")
# (Your LLM call)
lai.end_event(result="Found Stanford University") # Optional 

lai.end_step(action="Used search", eval_score=5, eval_description="Found Stanford University") # Optional

lai.end_session(is_successful=True) # Optional 
```

---

## üöÄ Minimal Instrumentation Example

Thanks to Lucidic's automatic features, you can instrument existing workflows with just **2 lines of code**:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
lai.init(providers=["openai"])  # Or ["anthropic"], ["langchain"], etc.

# That's it! Your existing code now has full observability
```

Here's a complete example showing how minimal the setup can be:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from openai import OpenAI

# Just these 2 lines to add complete observability!
lai.init(providers=["openai"])

# Your existing code remains unchanged
client = OpenAI()

def analyze_text(text):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze this: {text}"}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

def summarize_text(text):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize this: {text}"}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Your workflow runs normally
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
analysis = analyze_text(text)
summary = summarize_text(analysis)
print(summary)

# When script exits, Lucidic automatically:
# 1. Creates steps for each distinct operation
# 2. Creates events for each LLM call
# 3. Ends all steps properly
# 4. Ends the session
# 5. Sends everything to your dashboard
```

### What Happens Automatically:

1. **Session Creation**: A session starts when you call `init()`
2. **Step Creation**: Steps are auto-created when LLM calls happen
3. **Event Creation**: Every LLM call becomes an event automatically
4. **Step Ending**: Active steps are auto-ended when the session ends
5. **Session Ending**: The session auto-ends when your script exits
6. **Data Upload**: All tracking data is sent to your dashboard

This means you can add Lucidic to any existing Python script that uses supported LLM providers and immediately get full visibility into your AI workflows!
