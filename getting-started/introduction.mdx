description: Get started with understanding how and why our agent observability platform works.

If you're interested in getting set up, check out the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation).

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Your Agent's Control Room

AI agents donâ€™t just make predictions â€” they perform **multi-step workflows**, invoke tools, navigate interfaces, and adapt in real-time.

That complexity comes at a cost: itâ€™s easy for agents to behave unexpectedly, fail silently, or succeed for the wrong reasons.

We built this platform to give you **deep observability** into how your agent thinks, acts, and learns â€” across every run.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Observability Matters

Running an agent once doesn't tell you how it behaves.

- Agents are **non-deterministic**
- They're made of **chained actions**, not just outputs
- A single successful session can hide dozens of edge cases

To build agents you can trust, you need to see what they're doing â€” and why.

## ðŸ›  What This Platform Does

We help you:

- Analyze individual [Sessions](/features/workflow-sandbox) of agent behavior
- Inspect each [Step](/core-concepts/steps) and the [Events](/core-concepts/events) within
- Run [Mass Simulations](/features/mass-simulation-overview) to observe variability at scale
- Visualize agent behavior through [Workflow Trajectories](/features/workflow-trajectory)
- Define structured, flexible [Rubric Evaluations](/features/rubrics)
- Version and experiment with prompts via [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db)
- Debug stuck logic using [Time Travel](/features/time-travel)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Ready to dive in?

- **[Install the SDK](/getting-started/installation)** â€” Install the Lucidic SDK 
- **[Get Started in the UI](/getting-started/dashboard)** â€” Run your first Session and view the dashboard
- **[Use the Python SDK](/getting-started/final-instructions)** â€” Record and evaluate agents from your code

Weâ€™re excited to help you build agents that are **observable**, **debuggable**, and **production-ready**.
