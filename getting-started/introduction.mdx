description: Get started with understanding how and why our agent observability platform works.

If you're interested in getting set up, check out the [dashboard guide](/getting-started/dashboard).

# 👋 Welcome to Your Agent's Control Room

AI agents don’t just make predictions — they perform **multi-step workflows**, invoke tools, navigate interfaces, and adapt in real-time.

That complexity comes at a cost: it’s easy for agents to behave unexpectedly, fail silently, or succeed for the wrong reasons.

We built this platform to give you **deep observability** into how your agent thinks, acts, and learns — across every run.

---

## 🧠 Why Observability Matters

Running an agent once doesn't tell you how it behaves.

- Agents are **non-deterministic**
- They're made of **chained actions**, not just outputs
- A single successful session can hide dozens of edge cases

To build agents you can trust, you need to see what they're doing — and why.

## 🛠 What This Platform Does

We help you:

- Analyze individual [Sessions](/features/workflow-sandbox) of agent behavior
- Inspect each [Step](/core-concepts/steps) and the [Events](/core-concepts/events) within
- Run [Mass Simulations](/features/mass-simulation-overview) to observe variability at scale
- Visualize agent behavior through [Workflow Trajectories](/features/workflow-trajectory)
- Define structured, flexible [Rubric Evaluations](/features/rubrics)
- Version and experiment with prompts via [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db)
- Debug stuck logic using [Time Travel](/features/time-travel)

## 🎯 Automatic Instrumentation

Lucidic is designed to be as **non-intrusive** as possible. With just two lines of code, you get:

- **Auto Event Creation**: LLM calls from supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, PydanticAI) are automatically captured
- **Auto Step Creation**: If no step exists when an LLM call occurs, one is created automatically
- **Auto-Ending Steps**: Steps are automatically ended when your session ends
- **Auto-End Sessions**: Sessions automatically close when your script exits
- **Zero-Config Tracking**: Just import, initialize with providers, and everything else is handled

This means you can instrument existing workflows with minimal changes:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
lai.init(providers=["openai"])  # That's it! All OpenAI calls are now tracked
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Ready to dive in?

- **[Get Started in the UI](/getting-started/dashboard)** — Run your first Session and view the dashboard
- **[Use the Python SDK](/getting-started/final-instructions)** — Record and evaluate agents from your code

We’re excited to help you build agents that are **observable**, **debuggable**, and **production-ready**.
