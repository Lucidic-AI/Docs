Lucidic is the **complete agentic engineering** platform that helps you understand, test, and improve your AI agents. We provide full observability into multi-step workflows and custom evaluations, letting you pinpoint why agents succeed or fail. We make debugging and performance tuning fast, systematic, and scalable.

## Why Observability Matters

Running an agent once doesn't tell you how it behaves.

- Agents are **non-deterministic**
- They're made of **chained actions**, not just outputs
- A single successful session can hide dozens of edge cases

To build agents you can trust, you need to see what they're doing — and why.

## What This Platform Does

We help you:

- Analyze individual [Sessions](/features/workflow-sandbox) of agent behavior
- Inspect each [Step](/core-concepts/steps) and the [Events](/core-concepts/events) within
- Run [Mass Simulations](/features/mass-simulation-overview) to observe variability at scale
- Visualize agent behavior through [Workflow Trajectories](/features/workflow-trajectory)
- Define structured, flexible [Rubric Evaluations](/features/rubrics)
- Version and experiment with prompts via [Prompt DB](/features/prompt-db)
- Debug stuck logic using [Time Travel](/features/time-travel)

## Automatic Instrumentation

Lucidic is designed to be as **non-intrusive** as possible. With just two lines of code, you get:

- **Auto Event Creation**: LLM calls from supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, PydanticAI) are automatically captured
- **Auto Step Creation**: If no step exists when an LLM call occurs, one is created automatically
- **Auto-Ending Steps**: Steps are automatically ended when your session ends
- **Auto Session Ending**: Sessions automatically end when your script exits via an `atexit` handler
- **Auto Cost Tracking**: Token usage and costs are calculated automatically for each LLM call
- **Auto Error Handling**: Failed operations are tracked without breaking your workflow

### How It Works

When you initialize Lucidic with a provider:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
lai.init(providers=["openai"])
```

The SDK:
1. **Instruments the provider** using OpenTelemetry under the hood
2. **Intercepts all API calls** to track inputs, outputs, tokens, and timing
3. **Creates steps and events automatically** as your code runs
4. **Handles cleanup gracefully** even if your script crashes

This means you can add Lucidic to existing codebases without any refactoring - just add the two lines at the top of your script and you're done!

```python
import lucidicai as lai
lai.init(providers=["openai"])  # That's it! All OpenAI calls are now tracked
```

## Next Steps

Ready to dive in?

- **[Get Started in the UI](/getting-started/dashboard)** — Run your first Session and view the dashboard
- **[Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart)** — Add 2 lines of code to track your agents
- **[Use the TypeScript SDK](/typescript-sdk/overview)** — Full observability for your TypeScript/JavaScript applications

We're excited to help you build agents that are **observable**, **debuggable**, and **production-ready**.
