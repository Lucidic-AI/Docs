title: Creating a Mass Simulation
description: Learn how to create a mass simulation using the Python SDK and in the UI

A Mass Simulation is a collection of [Sessions](/core-concepts/sessions) where the same agent runs the same task multiple times. Due to the inherent non-determinism of autonomous agents, a single run is often misleading — Mass Sims let you observe what your agent can do, usually does, and sometimes fails to do.

Learn more about Mass Sims in the [Mass Simulations](/core-concepts/mass-simulations) section.
>There are 2 ways to create a mass sim: [1) in the UI](#1-create-in-ui) OR [2) using the Python SDK](#2-create-in-python-sdk)

## How to Create a Mass Simulation

### 1. Create in UI
- Go to the **"Mass Sims"** tab inside your Agent
> _![api key2](/images/masssimcreation.png)_

- Click **"Create New Mass Simulation"**
- Copy the **Mass Sim ID** into your SDK:

```python
lai.init(
    session_name="run_37",
    providers=["openai"],
    mass_sim_id="abc123"
)
```
- **You're done!** Now the sessions that you run under this mass simulation ID will be grouped together into one mass simulation. If you want to create another one, just repeat the process and make sure to use the right mass sim ID!

### 2. Create in Python SDK

This approach to creating a mass simulation doesn't need any UI interaction at all! It is often more convenient to create a mass simulation using the Python SDK if you want to do things such as create a script that creates multiple mass simulations.

You can programmatically create a mass simulation using the `create_mass_sim()` function:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`mass_sim_name`** | str | A descriptive name for your mass simulation. |
| **`total_num_sessions`** | int | The number of sessions to run in this simulation. |
| **`lucidic_api_key`** | str (optional IF set as environment variable) | Your Lucidic API key. |
| **`agent_id`** | str (optional IF set as environment variable) | Your Lucidic Agent ID. |
| **`task`** | str (optional) | The task description for all sessions in this simulation. |
| **`tags`** | list (optional) | A list of tags to categorize this mass simulation. |


```python
import lucidicai as lai

mass_sim_id = lai.create_mass_sim(
    mass_sim_name="search_performance_test",
    total_num_sessions=50,
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",  # Or use env var: LUCIDIC_API_KEY
    agent_id="your-agent-id",        # Or use env var: LUCIDIC_AGENT_ID
    task="Search Wikipedia for Steve Jobs biography",
    tags=["search", "performance", "wikipedia"]
)

print(f"Created mass simulation with ID: {mass_sim_id}")
```

#### Returns

* A string containing the unique ID of the created mass simulation.

#### Example Usage

Create a mass simulation and then use the returned ID in your session initialization:

```python
import lucidicai as lai

# Create a mass simulation with 25 sessions
mass_sim_id = lai.create_mass_sim(
    mass_sim_name="product_search_test",
    total_num_sessions=25,
    task="Search for iPhone 15 Pro Max",
    tags=["gemini", "search", "e-commerce"]
)

# Use the mass_sim_id in your session initialization
lai.init(
    session_name="search_run",
    providers=["gemini"],
    mass_sim_id=mass_sim_id
)

# Continue with your agent logic...
```

## 🏃 How to Run your Mass Simulation

A [Mass Simulation](/core-concepts/mass-simulations) is just a way to group multiple sessions with the same task together and see the analytics of the sessions as a whole. 

Therefore, it is still necessary to run the sessions under the mass simulation ID. 

Feel free to run your sessions however you like! For your convenience, we created two bash scripts to help you run your sessions in a loop. 

### 1. Running the sessions in a mass simulation sequentially:

This means it will run your agent script one at a time, waiting for each session to finish before running the next one.

```bash
for i in {1..[n]}; do python3 [your-script.py]; done
```
Where `n` is the number of sessions you want to run and `your-script.py` is the file path from the current directory to the script that runs your agent.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do python3 examples/models/gemini.py; done
```

This would run the `gemini.py` agent 5 times.

### 2. Running the sessions in a mass simulation in parallel:

This means it will run your agent script multiple times at the same time (in parallel), so it will run faster.

> **Important Note:** If you are running more than **5** sessions in parallel, ensure that your computer can handle it!

```bash
for i in {1..[n]}; do python3 [your-script.py]&; done
```
> **Note:** The `&` at the end of the command runs the process in the background and allows you to run multiple processes at the same time.

Where `n` is the number of sessions you want to run and `your-script.py` is the file path from the current directory to the script that runs your agent.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do python3 examples/models/gemini.py&; done
```

This would run the `gemini.py` agent 5 times in parallel (i.e. launch 5 processes at the same time).
