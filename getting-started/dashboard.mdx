title: Dashboard Setup (Part 1)
description: Learn how to set up your project, agent, and API key in the Lucidic dashboard.
---
> **Note:** Setup has two parts — (1) connecting it to the [Lucidic Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard) (below), and (2) [installing LucidicAI and setting up steps, events, and sessions in your code](/getting-started/final-instructions).

# Getting Started in the Dashboard

Before you can track your agent’s sessions in code, you’ll need to set up your environment in the **Lucidic web dashboard**.

---

## 1. Create an Account or Sign In

Go to [dashboard.lucidic.ai](https://dashboard.lucidic.ai) and sign in:

- Use **Google login** or
- Create an account with your email + password

> _![login screen](/images/login.png)_

---

## 2. Create a Project

Projects are high-level containers for your work — usually one per app, workflow, or team.

- Click **"New Project"**
- Name it something meaningful (e.g. `wikipedia-agent`, `finetuning-dashboard`, etc.)

---

## 3. Create an Agent

Inside your project:

- Click **"New Agent"**
- Provide a name and choose an icon

Agents represent individual autonomous systems (e.g. a browser agent, a research assistant, a planner).

## 4. Generate an API Key

You’ll need an API key to authenticate your SDK.

- Go to the **"API Keys"** icon in the bottom left corner in the side bar 
- Click **"Create API Key"**
- Copy the key somewhere safe - you won't be able to see it again!

## 5. Plug Into Python

Once you’ve got:

- **API Key**
- **Agent ID**

You’re ready to run sessions from code.

Paste them into:

```python
lai.init(
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    agent_id="your-agent-id"
)
```

Or set them as environment variables:

```bash
export LUCIDIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export LUCIDIC_AGENT_ID="your-agent-id"
```

---

## 6. (Optional) Create a Mass Simulation

If you want to run many sessions as part of a single evaluation:

- Go to the **"Mass Sims"** tab inside your Agent
> _![api key2](/images/masssimcreation.png)_

- Click **"New Mass Simulation"** on the top right of the table
- Copy the **Mass Sim ID** into your SDK:

```python
# assuming environment variables are set
lai.init(
    mass_sim_id="abc123"
)
```

This will link that run to your high-level simulation — perfect for testing prompt changes, model swaps, or behavior analysis at scale.
To learn more about mass simulations, see [Mass Simulations](/features/mass-simulations). To learn more about creation of mass simulations, see [Creating a Mass Simulation](/getting-started/masssim).

## You're Ready!

Now that your dashboard is set up, head to [Using the Python SDK](/getting-started/final-instructions) to run your first session.
