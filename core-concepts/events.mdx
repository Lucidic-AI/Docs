# ⚙️ Events

An **Event** is the most granular unit of action in your agent's execution trace. Events represent atomic operations — like LLM calls, API requests, or tool invocations — that occur *within* a [Step](/steps).

If a **Step** is the macro decision (“go to a new site”), then an **Event** is the micro-action (“run an LLM call to decide the next URL”).

## 🧬 Event Structure

Each Event includes (based on what you pass in):

- **Description**: of the event (e.g., “LLM: What site should I go to next?”)
- **Result**: the output of your event (e.g., model output, API response, return value)
- **Cost**: how much it cost to run this event (e.g. $0.01)
- **Model name**: for LLM events (e.g. `gpt-4o`)
- **Screenshots**: for visual events (e.g. browser screenshots)

The following are **generated automatically** by us and provided to you on the **dashboard**:
- **Summary**: LLM-generated summary of the event
- **Timestamps**: when the event started and ended

## 🔍 What Counts as an Event?

Events can include:

- 🤖 **LLM call** (e.g. reasoning about what action to take)
- 🌐 **API call** (e.g. fetching data from a third-party tool)
- 🛠️ **Tool invocation** (e.g. web scraping, search)
- 🧮 **Internal computations** (e.g. custom heuristics or logic)
- 💡 **Agent “thoughts”** captured from internal logs

You determine what gets logged as an **Event**. The more fine-grained, the better your observability.

## 🧠 Why Events Matter

Events help you:

- **Debug *inside* a step**
- **Understand why an action was chosen**
- **View raw outputs from models or tools**
- **Measure cost attribution at the finest level**
- **Identify timing bottlenecks**
- **Analyze failure causes (e.g. bad model output, timeout, incorrect API usage)**

## 🕵️‍♀️ Debugging Example

```text
Step: Visit Stanford site
├── Event: LLM call → "Which university website should I go to?"
│   └── Result: "Stanford.edu"
├── Event: Visit URL → "https://stanford.edu"
└── Event: DOM scrape → "Extract list of faculty"
```

Each event gives you a breadcrumb trail of micro-decisions that led to the step's result.


---

## 💸 Cost and Performance

Each Event tracks its **cost**, **duration**, and **model identity** (for LLMs). This lets you:

- **Break down session cost by step or event**
- **Track model usage across different sessions**
- **Optimize high-cost actions**


> **Note:** We recommend logging Events for every tool or model your agent uses to maximize observability.
