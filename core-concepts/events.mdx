# ⚙️ Events

An **Event** is the most granular unit of action in your agent's execution trace. Events represent atomic operations — like LLM calls, API requests, or tool invocations — that occur *within* a [Step](/steps).

If a **Step** is the macro decision (“go to a new site”), then an **Event** is the micro-action (“run an LLM call to decide the next URL”).

---

## 🧬 Event Structure

Each Event includes:

- A description of the event (e.g., “LLM: What site should I go to next?”)
- The result (e.g., model output, API response, return value)
- A summary (optional, often LLM-generated)
- Timestamps
- Cost and success/failure metadata
- Model name (for LLM events)

## 🔍 What Counts as an Event?

Events can include:

- 🤖 **LLM call** (e.g. reasoning about what action to take)
- 🌐 **API call** (e.g. fetching data from a third-party tool)
- 🛠️ **Tool invocation** (e.g. web scraping, search)
- 🧮 **Internal computations** (e.g. custom heuristics or logic)
- 💡 **Agent “thoughts”** captured from internal logs

Your agent determines what gets logged as an Event. The more fine-grained, the better your observability.

## 🧠 Why Events Matter

Events help you:

- Debug *inside* a step
- Understand why an action was chosen
- View raw outputs from models or tools
- Measure cost attribution at the finest level
- Identify timing bottlenecks
- Analyze failure causes (e.g. bad model output, timeout, incorrect API usage)

## 🕵️‍♀️ Debugging Example

```text
Step: Visit Stanford site
├── Event: LLM call → "Which university website should I go to?"
│   └── Result: "Stanford.edu"
├── Event: Visit URL → "https://stanford.edu"
└── Event: DOM scrape → "Extract list of faculty"
```

Each event gives you a breadcrumb trail of micro-decisions that led to the step's result.


---

## 💸 Cost and Performance

Each Event tracks its **cost**, **duration**, and **model identity** (for LLMs). This lets you:

- Break down session cost by step or event
- Track model usage across different sessions
- Optimize high-cost actions

<Callout type="note">
We recommend logging Events for every tool or model your agent uses to maximize observability.

## 📈 Event Summary Fields

You can optionally pass or generate:

- `summary`: a short one-line TL;DR of what the event did
- `description`: a raw string of what the agent attempted (human- or agent-written)
- `result`: the returned content or output

These fields help contextualize what happened without reading full logs.
