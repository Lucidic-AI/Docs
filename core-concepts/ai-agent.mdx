# What Is an AI Agent?

We define an **AI agent** as a system that:

> **Observes**, **thinks**, and **acts** — repeatedly — in pursuit of a goal.

Unlike simple LLM prompts or single-shot tasks, agents operate over **time**, across **states**, and with **autonomy**. They string together sequences of decisions, often using tools, models, and memory to move toward a defined objective.

---

## More Than Just an Output

An AI agent is **not** just:

- An LLM response
- A tool call
- A single API interaction

Instead, an agent is a full **workflow** — a chain of observations and actions, each informed by the previous state and the current goal.

Every agent session is like a mini program: it runs, mutates, fails, retries, succeeds — and leaves behind a trace of what happened.

---

## What a Good Agent Should Do

We believe agents should be:

### Goal-Directed  
Every action should move the agent toward an end objective.

### Observant  
Agents should react to new information, adapt to the environment, and revise their plans.

### Iterative  
They should handle multi-step logic, not just one-shot commands.

### Tool-Using  
Agents should augment themselves with external APIs, models, or functions when needed.

### Observable  
To be trusted and improved, agents must be **inspectable**, **replayable**, and **debuggable**.

## The Production Gap

Many agents today:

- Succeed *sometimes* — but fail silently
- Work on *one run* — but fail across 10
- Make decisions — but don’t explain or expose why

This is what we're here to fix.

We help you:

- Understand what your agent is doing — across every run
- Visualize its decision-making
- Evaluate its reasoning
- Improve reliability and performance

Until agents can be **trusted**, they can’t be **deployed**.

## Our North Star

We believe the best AI agents will eventually behave like:

> **Dynamic collaborators** — that can think, act, explain themselves, and get better over time.

And that starts with making them transparent, accountable, and testable — today.
