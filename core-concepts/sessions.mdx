# 📦 Sessions

A **Session** represents a single run of an AI agent as it attempts to complete a task. It captures the full trace of the agent’s behavior — from initial state to final outcome — and provides deep visibility into each decision, action, and outcome along the way.

---

## 🧠 What is a Session?

A Session is a top-level unit of observability. It begins when an agent starts a task and ends when the task is either completed, failed, or interrupted. 
Learn to create a session [here](/getting-started/final-instructions)

Within each Session UI in Lucidic or what we call [workflow sandbox](/features/workflow-sandbox), you’ll find:

- A **timeline of Steps** (agent states and transitions)
- Fine-grained **Events** (e.g. LLM calls, API responses) inside each Step
- A **workflow graph** visualizing the session’s trajectory
- A **GIF/video replay** of the agent’s interaction (if available)
- Evaluation scores, cost metrics, metadata, and more

<Callout type="info">
Sessions are non-deterministic by nature. Re-running the same task may lead to different outcomes due to the agent’s autonomy and stochasticity.

## 🧬 Session Structure

### Step and Event Hierarchy

A Session is composed of ordered **Steps**, each representing a unique state and action taken by the agent. Each Step contains multiple **Events**, representing granular atomic operations like LLM calls or API hits.

```python
Session
└── Step
    ├── Event
    ├── Event
    └── ...
```

<Callout type="note">
Steps and Events are documented [here →](/steps) and [here →](/events) respectively.
</Callout>

## 📺 Session Dashboard or Workflow Sandbox

Each Session in the [workflow sandbox](/features/workflow-sandbox) includes:

- **Overview metrics**: duration, step count, cost, completion status
- **Visual replay**: full session video or GIF (if captured)
- **Interactive workflow graph**: clickable nodes for each step
- **Step-by-step explorer**: deep dive into state/action/event logs
- **Evaluation scores**: human or LLM-generated



---

## 📊 Evaluation and Scoring

Sessions can be evaluated via multiple systems:

### 1. **User-Provided Eval Score**
Passed in at runtime using the Python SDK. Useful for customized or domain-specific scoring.

```python
lai.end_session(
    is_successful=True,
    session_eval="4.5",  # Your custom score which is not a rubric
    session_eval_reason="Agent completed primary objectives but took longer than expected"
)
```

### 2. **Rubric-Based Evaluation**
Define structured, weighted rubrics with multiple criteria and score definitions.

```yaml
criteria:
  - name: "Repeated Site Visits"
    weights: 0.4
    scores:
      10: "Never visited a site twice"
      1: "Frequently revisited pages"

  - name: "Average Step Time"
    weight: 0.6
    ...
```

These rubrics produce both per-criterion and composite scores.

### 3. **Default Evaluation**
Our built-in system outputs:
- A score (0 or 1) based on task completion
- A list of “wrong” or suboptimal steps (automatically identified)
- Graph highlights of failure points

## 🕵️‍♂️ Debugging with Sessions

Sessions give you rich insight into how your agent operates and where it goes wrong:

- **Replay stuck behavior** via video
- **Identify high-cost operations**
- **Trace decision-making** back to specific prompts or events
- **Group failing steps** into unified nodes in the graph
- **Track revisited states** and looping patterns

Coming soon:
- **Prompt DB integration**: live-edit prompts your agent uses at runtime


---

## 📁 Metadata and Tagging

Each Session contains rich metadata including:

- Task description
- Agent identity and version
- Cost
- Timestamps
- Link to parent Mass Simulation (if applicable)
- Replay data and graph reference

Planned: **semantic tagging**, **search**, and **session filtering** based on LLM-labeled themes.
