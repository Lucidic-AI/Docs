# 🌐 Mass Simulations

A **Mass Simulation** is a collection of Sessions where the **same agent runs the same task multiple times**. Due to the inherent **non-determinism** of autonomous agents, a single run is often misleading — Mass Sims let you observe what your agent *can* do, *usually* does, and *sometimes* fails to do.

## 🎯 Why Mass Sims?

Mass Sims help answer:

- What are the **possible paths** my agent might take?
- Where does the agent behave **inconsistently**?
- Are there **probabilistic failure modes** I’m not catching in single sessions?
- What is the agent’s **real-world reliability** over many runs?

<Callout type="warning">
If your agent succeeds only 80–90% of the time, it’s not ready for production. Mass Sims reveal where and why the other 10–20% breaks.

## 🧬 Structure

Each Mass Simulation:

- Groups **many Sessions** that run the **same task**
- Computes a unified **Workflow Trajectory graph**
- Clusters Steps across Sessions based on **similar states**
- Shows a **probabilistic map** of your agent’s possible decisions

```python
MassSim
├── Session 1
│   └── Steps → Events
├── Session 2
│   └── Steps → Events
├── ...
└── Workflow Trajectory Graph (merged from all Sessions)
```
