# 🌐 Mass Simulations

A **Mass Simulation** is a collection of Sessions where the **same agent runs the same task multiple times**. Due to the inherent **non-determinism** of autonomous agents, a single run is often misleading — Mass Sims let you observe what your agent *can* do, *usually* does, and *sometimes* fails to do.

---

## 🎯 Why Mass Sims?

Mass Sims help answer:

- What are the **possible paths** my agent might take?
- Where does the agent behave **inconsistently**?
- Are there **probabilistic failure modes** I’m not catching in single sessions?
- What is the agent’s **real-world reliability** over many runs?

<Callout type="warning">
If your agent succeeds only 80–90% of the time, it’s not ready for production. Mass Sims reveal where and why the other 10–20% breaks.

## 🧬 Structure

Each Mass Simulation:

- Groups **many Sessions** that run the **same task**
- Computes a unified **Workflow Trajectory graph**
- Clusters Steps across Sessions based on **similar states**
- Shows a **probabilistic map** of your agent’s possible decisions

```python
MassSim
├── Session 1
│   └── Steps → Events
├── Session 2
│   └── Steps → Events
├── ...
└── Workflow Trajectory Graph (merged from all Sessions)
```

---

## 🧠 Understanding the Workflow Trajectory

At the heart of a Mass Sim is the **Workflow Trajectory Graph** — a merged, clustered graph representing all agent behavior across sessions.

- **Nodes** = grouped agent states (e.g. same URL, same screenshot)
- **Edges** = actions taken between states
- **Weights** = frequency of transition across Sessions

> 📷 _**[Insert example of trajectory graph with probabilistic branching and node clustering]**_

Clicking a node shows:

- All individual Sessions that passed through that state
- Session-specific context (state, action, screenshot, etc.)

Clicking an edge shows:

- All sessions where that exact state transition occurred

<Callout type="info">
Use this graph to identify branching behaviors, loops, edge cases, and moments where your agent is inconsistent or fragile.

## 🧪 Evaluation (Planned)

Currently, each Session in a Mass Sim can be evaluated individually via:

- [Eval Scores](/sessions#evaluation-and-scoring)
- [Custom Rubrics](/sessions#rubric-based-evaluation)
- [Default completion checks](/sessions#default-evaluation)

In the future, Mass Sims will support:

- **Aggregate scores** across Sessions
- **Reliability analytics**
- **Failure pattern detection**
- **Production monitoring integrations**

---

## ⚖️ Use Case: Agent QA at Scale

Mass Sims are designed for:

- **Stress testing** your agent’s logic across repeated runs
- Observing **failure frequency** and **failure types**
- Detecting **stochastic bugs** (e.g. flaky prompt behavior)
- Visualizing **what’s possible**, not just what happened once

<Callout type="note">
Like unit tests in traditional software, agents need diverse test runs to ensure robustness. Mass Sims are your testing framework for agents.

## 🚀 How to Run a Mass Sim

### 1. Create in UI

- Go to the **Mass Simulations** tab in your dashboard
- Create a new simulation and note the **Mass Sim ID**

### 2. Pass ID in SDK

Use the Python SDK to attach your session to the Mass Sim:

```python
session = AgentSession(
    mass_sim_id="abc123",
    ...
)
```

All sessions created with this ID will be grouped under the same Mass Sim and contribute to the trajectory graph.
