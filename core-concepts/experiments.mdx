description: Organize and analyze multiple AI agent sessions at scale with experiments

# Experiments

An **Experiment** is an organizational container that groups multiple related sessions together for bulk analysis and evaluation. Experiments enable you to identify patterns, track performance metrics, and detect failure modes across multiple runs of your AI agents.

---

## What is an Experiment?

An Experiment provides a framework for systematically analyzing agent behavior at scale. While a single session shows you how your agent performed once, an experiment reveals how it performs consistently across many executions.

Think of experiments as a way to:
- **Group related test runs** for comparative analysis
- **Apply consistent evaluation** across all sessions
- **Identify failure patterns** that only emerge at scale
- **Track performance trends** over time and configurations

<Note type="info">
Experiments are created and managed through the Lucidic Dashboard. Your SDKs can then add sessions to these experiments programmatically.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

### Experiment Structure

```
Agent
└── Experiment (created in dashboard)
    ├── Sessions (added via dashboard or SDK)
    │   ├── Steps
    │   └── Events
    ├── Rubrics (evaluation criteria)
    └── Failure Groups (auto-generated patterns)
```

### Creating Experiments

Experiments are created exclusively through the Lucidic Dashboard:

1. Navigate to your agent's Session History
2. Select sessions you want to analyze together
3. Click "Create Experiment"
4. Configure name, description, tags, and rubrics
5. Note the experiment ID for SDK integration

### Adding Sessions

Once created, you can add sessions to experiments in two ways:

**Via Dashboard:**
- Select existing sessions
- Add to experiment through the UI

**Via SDK:**
```python
# Python
lai.init(
    session_name="Test Run",
    experiment_id="exp-uuid-from-dashboard"
)
```

```typescript
// TypeScript
await lai.init({
    sessionName: "Test Run",
    experimentId: "exp-uuid-from-dashboard"
})
```

## Core Features

### 1. Bulk Session Analysis

Experiments aggregate data across all included sessions:
- **Success rates** - Overall and per-criteria pass rates
- **Cost analysis** - Average, total, and distribution metrics
- **Duration statistics** - Performance timing patterns
- **Completion funnels** - Where agents succeed or fail

### 2. Failure Pattern Detection

The platform automatically identifies and groups similar failures:
- **AI-powered clustering** - Groups similar error patterns
- **Named categories** - Each group gets descriptive labels
- **Affected session tracking** - See which runs had each issue
- **Root cause hints** - Explanations of what went wrong

<Note type="warning">
Failure analysis requires evaluation credits (1 credit per 10 sessions).
</Note>

### 3. Evaluation Rubrics

Apply consistent evaluation criteria across all sessions:
- **Score rubrics** - Weighted numerical evaluations (0-10)
- **Pass/Fail rubrics** - Binary success criteria
- **Multi-criteria** - Combine multiple evaluation dimensions
- **Automatic application** - Rubrics run on all experiment sessions

### 4. Comparative Analysis

Experiments excel at comparison scenarios:
- **A/B testing** - Compare different prompts or configurations
- **Regression detection** - Ensure changes don't degrade performance
- **Version comparison** - Track improvements across iterations
- **Baseline establishment** - Set performance benchmarks

---

## Common Use Cases

### A/B Testing

Test different configurations to find optimal settings:

```python
# Create two experiments in dashboard first
EXPERIMENT_A = "exp-uuid-variant-a"  # From dashboard
EXPERIMENT_B = "exp-uuid-variant-b"  # From dashboard

# Run tests with each variant
for test_case in test_cases:
    # Variant A
    lai.init(
        session_name=f"Test {test_case.id} - A",
        experiment_id=EXPERIMENT_A
    )
    run_with_config_a(test_case)
    lai.end_session()
    
    # Variant B
    lai.init(
        session_name=f"Test {test_case.id} - B", 
        experiment_id=EXPERIMENT_B
    )
    run_with_config_b(test_case)
    lai.end_session()
```

### Regression Testing

Ensure new changes maintain performance:

```python
# Baseline experiment created in dashboard
BASELINE_EXPERIMENT = "exp-baseline-v1"

# After making changes, create new experiment in dashboard
NEW_VERSION_EXPERIMENT = "exp-candidate-v2"

# Run same test suite on both
for test in regression_suite:
    lai.init(
        session_name=test.name,
        experiment_id=NEW_VERSION_EXPERIMENT
    )
    run_test(test)
    lai.end_session()
```

### Load Testing

Analyze behavior under stress:

```python
# Create load test experiment in dashboard
LOAD_TEST_EXPERIMENT = "exp-load-test-1000"

# Run many concurrent sessions
import concurrent.futures

def run_session(i):
    lai.init(
        session_name=f"Load Test {i}",
        experiment_id=LOAD_TEST_EXPERIMENT
    )
    # Your agent workflow
    lai.end_session()

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(run_session, i) for i in range(1000)]
```

### Performance Benchmarking

Establish and track performance baselines:

```python
# Monthly performance experiments (created in dashboard)
experiments = {
    "January": "exp-perf-jan-2024",
    "February": "exp-perf-feb-2024",
    "March": "exp-perf-mar-2024"
}

# Run consistent test suite each month
current_month_exp = experiments["March"]
for benchmark in performance_benchmarks:
    lai.init(
        session_name=benchmark.name,
        experiment_id=current_month_exp,
        tags=["benchmark", "monthly"]
    )
    run_benchmark(benchmark)
    lai.end_session()
```

## Best Practices

### Experiment Design

1. **Clear scope** - Group sessions with similar purposes
2. **Meaningful names** - Use descriptive, searchable names
3. **Consistent tags** - Develop a tagging taxonomy
4. **Appropriate size** - 50-100 sessions for reliable patterns

### Workflow Recommendations

1. **Create in dashboard first** - Set up experiment before running code
2. **Note the ID** - Copy experiment ID for SDK use
3. **Apply rubrics early** - Configure evaluation criteria upfront
4. **Run analysis regularly** - Analyze after significant sessions added

### Organization Tips

- **One purpose per experiment** - Don't mix different test types
- **Version tracking** - Include version info in names/tags
- **Time boundaries** - Consider daily/weekly experiment groups
- **Documentation** - Use descriptions to explain purpose

---

## Limitations

- **Dashboard creation only** - Cannot create experiments via SDK
- **One experiment per session** - Sessions belong to single experiment
- **Credit costs** - Failure analysis consumes evaluation credits
- **Processing time** - Large experiments take time to analyze
