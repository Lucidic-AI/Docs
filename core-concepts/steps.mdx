# 🪜 Steps

A **Step** is a unit of execution within a [Session](/core-concepts/sessions). It captures both a snapshot of the agent’s **current state** and the **action taken** to transition to the next state. Steps are the backbone of a session timeline and form the nodes in your workflow graph.

Each Step may contain multiple underlying [Events](/core-concepts/events), such as tool calls, API requests, or LLM invocations.

## 🧬 Step Anatomy

Each Step records:

- The agent’s **state** (optional string + LLM-generated summary)
- The **goal** the agent is trying to accomplish (optional string + summary)
- The **action** taken to transition to the next step (with optional LLM-generated summary)
- **Timestamps** for start and update time
- **Cost** for operations within this step
- Whether **screenshots** were captured
- An **evaluation score** and **evaluation description** if provided or computed

More details can be found on programmatically what a **Step** looks like [here](/getting-started/final-instructions#🧭-step-2%3A-create-steps)

## 🎬 Screenshots and Visual State

**Steps** may include a **screenshot** that visually captures what the agent was seeing or interacting with at that moment. These can be critical for understanding UI-based agents or browser actions.

- Displayed in the **Step detail view**
- Used for **visual debugging**
- Stored per-step and accessible via the **dashboard**

## 💥 Evaluating Steps

Steps can be scored individually using:

- **User-provided scores**: log your own logic-based rating of a step
- **LLM-generated scores** (planned): use limited context to judge a step's quality
- **Default heuristics**: highlight stuck or repeated states

```python
lai.update_step(eval_score=0.3, eval_description="Tried to switch tabs but failed.")
```

> **Warning:** Step-level evaluation in isolation is often difficult without broader task context. We recommend pairing this with session-wide scoring or rubrics when possible.

## 🔄 Step Transitions & Workflow Graph

Steps link together to form the execution path of your agent:

```text
[state₀] --(action)--> [state₁] --(action)--> [state₂] ...
```

In your dashboard’s **Workflow Graph**, Steps are:

- Represented as **nodes**
- Clustered automatically when the state is repeated (e.g. looping or retries)
- Connected by labeled edges that represent the agent’s actions


---

## 🔍 Grouping & Graph Insight

When multiple Steps share the same state and similar actions (e.g., retries or confusion loops), they’re automatically grouped in the graph view. This helps surface:

- Stuck behavior (e.g., trying the same thing repeatedly)
- Revisiting states (e.g., reloading a site, flipping between tabs)
- Structural patterns (e.g., loops, branches, dead ends)

---

## 📁 Events Inside Steps

Each Step may contain multiple [Events](/events) — fine-grained units of work including:

- Tool invocations
- LLM calls
- API requests
- DOM scraping
- etc.


---

## 🧪 Debugging with Steps

Steps are the atomic unit of debugging:

- Replay exactly what the agent saw or did
- Inspect the agent’s thought process (via goal + action summaries)
- View logs and evaluations
