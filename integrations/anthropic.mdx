# 🤝 Anthropic Integration

Lucidic supports automatic tracking of **Anthropic Claude** completions in your agent sessions — with no extra instrumentation needed.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you initialize the SDK with:

```python
lai.init(..., providers=["anthropic"])
```

Lucidic will:

- **Instrument** the Anthropic client using OpenTelemetry
- **Automatically create events** for each Claude completion - no manual event creation needed
- Attach the LLM call to the **current active Step** (or auto-create one if none exists)
- Support both sync and async operations

---

## ✅ What Gets Captured

We automatically capture the following from Anthropic API calls:

- **Input**: your messages/prompt to Claude
- **Model**: the Claude model used (e.g. `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- **Output**: the Claude response (including streaming)
- **Token usage**: input and output tokens
- **Cost**: calculated based on token usage and model pricing
- **Timing**: duration of the API call
- **Images**: when using vision capabilities


---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

LLM calls are a core part of most agent workflows — but without visibility, it’s impossible to debug or optimize:

- Which call caused the **failure**?
- Which **step** was it part of?
- How much did it **cost**?
- What was the actual **response**?

This integration gives you full transparency, with **zero boilerplate**.

## 🧪 Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from anthropic import Anthropic

lai.init(
    session_name="claude_task",
    providers=["anthropic"]  # API key and agent ID from env vars
)

client = Anthropic()

lai.create_step(state="Planning", goal="Generate research questions")

# This call is automatically tracked as an event!
# No need for create_event() or end_event()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=500,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are 5 research ideas about climate change?"}]
)

lai.end_step(action="Generated ideas")
```

### Streaming Example

```python
# Streaming responses are also tracked automatically
stream = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}],
    stream=True
)

for event in stream:
    if event.type == "content_block_delta":
        print(event.delta.text, end="")
```

### Minimal Example - Auto Everything!

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from anthropic import Anthropic

# Just initialize - that's it!
lai.init(providers=["anthropic"])

client = Anthropic()

# Even without creating a step, this works!
# Lucidic will auto-create a step AND auto-create an event
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Claude!"}]
)

# Session auto-ends when script exits
```

## 🛠️ Notes

- Requires `anthropic` Python SDK installed (`pip install anthropic`)
- All Anthropic client methods are instrumented
- Both sync and async methods are supported
- If no step exists when an LLM call is made, Lucidic automatically creates one
- You can still manually use `create_event()` for additional context
- Works with the latest Anthropic Python SDK
