# 🤝 Anthropic Integration

Lucidic supports automatic tracking of **Anthropic Claude** completions in your agent sessions — with no extra instrumentation needed.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you initialize the SDK with:

```python
lai.init(..., provider="anthropic")
```

Lucidic will:

- **Monkey patch** `anthropic.Client().messages.create`
- Automatically capture each Claude completion as an **Event**
- Attach the LLM call to the **current active Step**

---

## ✅ What Gets Captured

Each Claude call is logged with:

- `description`: e.g. `"Claude call to claude-3-opus"`
- `model`: the Claude version used
- `cost`: estimated based on input/output tokens
- `result`: a summarized or truncated response
- Metadata like latency, success status, etc.


---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Claude is powerful — but debugging its outputs without traceability is painful.

With automatic Anthropic integration, you can:

- Trace LLM calls back to their context
- Measure cost and performance over time
- Identify which responses worked (and which failed)
- View model usage at a step-by-step level

---

## 🧪 Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
import anthropic

lai.init(
    session_name="claude_task",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    provider="anthropic"
)

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

lai.create_step(state="Planning", goal="Generate research questions")

# This call is automatically tracked!
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus",
    max_tokens=500,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are 5 research ideas about climate change?"}]
)

lai.end_step(is_successful=True, action="Generated ideas")
```

---

## 🛠️ Notes

- Requires `anthropic` Python SDK installed (`pip install anthropic`)
- Only `Client().messages.create` is currently patched
- You must have an active session and step for automatic event logging
- You can still manually use `create_event()` or `update_event()` as needed
