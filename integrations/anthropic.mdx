# ü§ù Anthropic Integration

Lucidic supports automatic tracking of **Anthropic Claude** completions in your agent sessions ‚Äî with no extra instrumentation needed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

When you initialize the SDK with:

```python
lai.init(..., provider="anthropic")
```

Lucidic will:

- **Monkey patch** `anthropic.Client().messages.create`
- Automatically capture each Claude completion as an **Event**
- Attach the LLM call to the **current active Step**

---

## ‚úÖ What Gets Captured

We automatically capture the following when you pass it to `anthropic.Client().messages.create`:

- **Input**: your prompt to Claude (e.g. `"What's the capital of France?"`)
- **Model**: the Claude model used (e.g. `claude-3-opus`, `claude-3`)
- **Output**: the Claude response

Based on your input, we automatically calculate the following:

- **Cost**: estimated based on input/output tokens


---

## üß† Why This Matters

LLM calls are a core part of most agent workflows ‚Äî but without visibility, it‚Äôs impossible to debug or optimize:

- Which call caused the **failure**?
- Which **step** was it part of?
- How much did it **cost**?
- What was the actual **response**?

This integration gives you full transparency, with **zero boilerplate**.

---

## üß™ Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
import anthropic

lai.init(
    session_name="claude_task",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    provider="anthropic"
)

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

lai.create_step(state="Planning", goal="Generate research questions")

# This call is automatically tracked!
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus",
    max_tokens=500,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are 5 research ideas about climate change?"}]
)

lai.end_step(is_successful=True, action="Generated ideas")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- Requires `anthropic` Python SDK installed (`pip install anthropic`)
- Only `Client().messages.create` is currently patched
- You must have an active session and step for automatic event logging
- You can still manually use `create_event()` or `update_event()` as needed
