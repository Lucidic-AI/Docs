description: Automatically track LangChain LLM calls by attaching Lucidic to your agent — even if it's deeply nested.

# 🔗 LangChain Integration

Lucidic integrates seamlessly with **LangChain** agents and chains — no need to rewrite your code or restructure your logic.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you use `provider="langchain"` with Lucidic, you can attach a special handler that will:

- **Recursively search** your agent for LangChain LLMs
- **Automatically attach itself** as a callback handler
- Capture LLM usage as **Lucidic Events**, grouped under the correct Step

This means you get full observability into your agent's reasoning — with zero boilerplate instrumentation.

---

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize Lucidic

```python
import lucidicai as lai

lai.init(
    session_name="langchain_agent_run",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    provider="langchain"
)
```

### 2. Attach to Your Agent

```python
handler = lai.LucidicLangchainHandler()
handler.attach_to_llms(agent)
```

✅ That’s it — even if your LLMs are deeply nested inside custom wrappers or chains, we’ll find and attach to them automatically.

---

## 🧠 What Gets Captured

For every LangChain LLM call, we’ll log:

- `description`: LLM method or chain origin
- `model`: if available (e.g. `gpt-4`)
- `cost`: if token counts are available
- `result`: response text or summary
- Timing and success metadata


---

## 🔍 Under the Hood

Here’s a simplified view of what’s happening when you call `attach_to_llms()`:

```python
def attach_to_llms(self, llm_or_chain_or_agent):
    if hasattr(obj, 'callbacks'):
        obj.callbacks.append(self)
    for attr in dir(obj):
        if hasattr(attr, 'callbacks'):
            attr.callbacks.append(self)
```

Your agent might be deeply nested — but Lucidic recursively walks through the object and **attaches itself to any LLMs it finds**.

> 📘 You don’t need to dig into `.llm_chain.llm` or manually insert the handler. We do that for you.

## 🧪 Full Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from my_agent import MyLangChainAgent

lai.init(
    session_name="langchain_test",
    agent_id="agent-123",
    provider="langchain"
)

agent = MyLangChainAgent()

handler = lai.LucidicLangchainHandler()
handler.attach_to_llms(agent)

agent.run("Search for Stanford University")
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- `langchain` installed
- Works with `BaseLanguageModel`, `LLMChain`, `AgentExecutor`, and custom toolchains
- You must call `attach_to_llms()` before executing the agent
- Events are attached to the **currently active Step**
