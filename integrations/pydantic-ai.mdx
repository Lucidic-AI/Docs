# ü§ù PydanticAI Integration

Lucidic makes it easy to **automatically track PydanticAI agent completions** as part of your agent's behavior ‚Äî no code changes required.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

When you set:

```python
lai.init(..., providers=["pydantic_ai"])
```

Lucidic will:

- **Monkey patch** PydanticAI's `AnthropicModel.request` and `OpenAIModel.request`
- Automatically log each agent call as an **Event**
- Attach the call to the currently active Step

This means:

- You don't need to call `create_event()` or `end_event()` manually
- You get full observability into prompts, model, cost, result, and more ‚Äî out of the box

---

## ‚úÖ What Gets Captured

Each PydanticAI call is tracked with:

- `description`: formatted messages sent to the model
- `model`: the underlying model name (e.g. `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `gpt-4`)
- `cost`: calculated based on token usage
- `result`: truncated summary of the response


---

## üß† Why This Matters

PydanticAI agent calls are a core part of most AI workflows ‚Äî but without visibility, it's impossible to debug or optimize:

- Which call caused the failure?
- Which step was it part of?
- How much did it cost?
- What was the actual response?

This integration gives you full transparency, with **zero boilerplate**.

## üß™ Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel

lai.init(
    session_name="pydantic_ai_run",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    providers=["pydantic_ai"]
)

model = AnthropicModel(model_name="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
agent = Agent(model=model, system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.")

lai.create_step(state="Research", goal="Generate research ideas")

# This call is automatically tracked!
response = await agent.run(
    user_prompt="What are 5 research ideas about climate change?"
)

lai.end_step(is_successful=True, action="Generated research ideas")
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- Both `AnthropicModel.request` and `OpenAIModel.request` are currently patched
- You must have an active session and step for events to be attached
- You can always override or add custom events using `create_event()` if needed
