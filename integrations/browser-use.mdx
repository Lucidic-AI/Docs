# 🌐 Browser Use Integration

[Browser Use](https://github.com/openaccess-ai-collective/browser-agent) is a popular open-source **browser agent** built on LangChain. We’ve created a **Lucidic-integrated fork** so you can track and debug your browser agent workflows with full session replay, step timelines, event logging, and prompt evaluation — right out of the box.

---

## 🚀 What We’ve Added

In our fork of the Browser Use agent:

- Lucidic calls like `lai.create_step()` and `lai.end_step()` are automatically inserted into the agent logic
- LLM and tool interactions are tracked as **Events**
- Support for Mass Sims, Prompt DB, and Rubric evaluations is built in
- Works with LangChain handler for full call graph coverage

---

## 🧭 How to Use It

### 1. Clone the Lucidic Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucidic-ai/browser-use-lai.git
cd browser-use
```

> 📘 This is a fork of the official repo with added observability.

---

### 2. Install Locally

```bash
pip install . ."[dev]"
```

This installs the agent in editable mode so you can tweak it if needed.

---

### 3. Use the LangChain Handler

Since Browser Use is built on LangChain, you still need to attach the Lucidic handler manually.

In your script:

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from browser_use.agent import BrowserAgent

# Initialize Lucidic
lai.init(
    session_name="browser_run",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    provider="langchain"
)

# Create agent and attach LangChain handler
agent = BrowserAgent()
handler = lai.LucidicLangchainHandler()
handler.attach_to_llms(agent)

# Run as usual
agent.run("Find the capital of Japan and report its population.")
```

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Get

With Lucidic integration, every run is:

- Logged as a **Session**
- Broken down into **Steps** (e.g. page navigation, tool usage)
- Populated with **Events** (e.g. LLM completions, actions)
- Replayable as a video or gif in the [Workflow Sandbox](/features/workflow-sandbox)
- Evaluated with custom or default [Rubrics](/features/rubrics)


---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Browser agents are complex — they:

- Navigate pages
- Interact with forms and tools
- Call LLMs with changing context

Lucidic helps you see **why they failed**, **how they acted**, and **what to improve** — across individual sessions or full-scale Mass Simulations.
