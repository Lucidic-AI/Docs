# ü§ù OpenAI Integration

Lucidic makes it easy to **automatically track OpenAI completions** as part of your agent's behavior ‚Äî no code changes required.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

When you set:

```python
lai.init(..., provider="openai")
```

Lucidic will:

- **Monkey patch** `openai.ChatCompletion.create`
- Automatically log each LLM call as an **Event**
- Attach the call to the currently active **Step**

This means:

- You don‚Äôt need to call `create_event()` or `end_event()` manually
- You get **full observability into prompt, model, cost, result, and more ‚Äî out of the box**

---

## ‚úÖ What Gets Captured

We automatically capture the following when you pass it to `openai.ChatCompletion.create`:

- **Input**: your prompt to Open AI (e.g. `"What's the capital of France?"`)
- **Model**: the model name (e.g. `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- **Output**: OpenAI response

Based on your input, we automatically calculate the following:

- **Cost**: calculated based on token usage

---

## üß† Why This Matters

LLM calls are a core part of most agent workflows ‚Äî but without visibility, it‚Äôs impossible to debug or optimize:

- Which call caused the **failure**?
- Which **step** was it part of?
- How much did it **cost**?
- What was the actual **response**?

This integration gives you full transparency, with **zero boilerplate**.

## üß™ Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
import openai

lai.init(
    session_name="chatbot_run",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    provider="openai"
)

lai.create_step(state="Intro", goal="Ask user for name")

# This call is automatically tracked!
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's your name?"}]
)

lai.end_step(is_successful=True, action="Generated greeting")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- Only `openai.ChatCompletion.create` is currently patched
- You must have an active session and step for events to be attached
- You can always override or add custom events using `create_event()` if needed
