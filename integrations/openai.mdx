# 🤝 OpenAI Integration

Lucidic makes it easy to **automatically track OpenAI completions** as part of your agent's behavior — no code changes required.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you set:

```python
lai.init(..., providers=["openai"])
```

Lucidic will:

- **Instrument** the OpenAI client using OpenTelemetry
- Automatically log each LLM call as an **Event**
- Attach the call to the currently active **Step**

This means:

- **Automatic Event Creation**: Every OpenAI API call is automatically captured as an event - no manual `create_event()` or `end_event()` needed
- You get **full observability into prompt, model, cost, result, and more — out of the box**
- Works with both sync and async OpenAI client methods
- Even if you forget to create a step, Lucidic will create one automatically when the LLM call happens

---

## ✅ What Gets Captured

We automatically capture the following from OpenAI API calls:

- **Input**: your messages/prompt to OpenAI
- **Model**: the model name (e.g. `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o`)
- **Output**: OpenAI response (including streaming responses)
- **Token usage**: input and output tokens
- **Cost**: calculated based on token usage and model pricing
- **Timing**: duration of the API call
- **Images**: when using vision models

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

LLM calls are a core part of most agent workflows — but without visibility, it’s impossible to debug or optimize:

- Which call caused the **failure**?
- Which **step** was it part of?
- How much did it **cost**?
- What was the actual **response**?

This integration gives you full transparency, with **zero boilerplate**.

## 🧪 Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from openai import OpenAI

lai.init(
    session_name="chatbot_run",
    providers=["openai"]  # API key and agent ID from env vars
)

lai.create_step(state="Intro", goal="Ask user for name")

# Create OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

# This call is automatically tracked as an event!
# No need for create_event() or end_event()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's your name?"}]
)

lai.end_step(action="Generated greeting")
```

### Minimal Example - Auto Everything!

```python
import lucidicai as lai
from openai import OpenAI

# Just initialize - that's it!
lai.init(providers=["openai"])

client = OpenAI()

# Even without creating a step, this works!
# Lucidic will auto-create a step AND auto-create an event
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

# Session auto-ends when script exits
```

### Streaming Example

```python
# Streaming responses are also tracked automatically
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

## 🛠️ Notes

- All OpenAI client methods are instrumented (chat completions, embeddings, etc.)
- Both sync and async methods are supported
- If no step exists when an LLM call is made, Lucidic automatically creates one
- You can always add custom events using `create_event()` for additional context
- Works with the latest OpenAI Python SDK (v1.0+)
