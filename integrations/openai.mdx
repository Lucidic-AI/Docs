# 🤝 OpenAI Integration

Lucidic makes it easy to **automatically track OpenAI completions** as part of your agent's behavior — no code changes required.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you set:

```python
lai.init(..., provider="openai")
```

Lucidic will:

- **Monkey patch** `openai.ChatCompletion.create`
- Automatically log each LLM call as an **Event**
- Attach the call to the currently active Step

This means:

- You don’t need to call `create_event()` or `end_event()` manually
- You get full observability into prompt, model, cost, result, and more — out of the box

---

## ✅ What Gets Captured

Each OpenAI call is tracked with:

- `description`: e.g. `"OpenAI call to gpt-4"`
- `model`: the model name (e.g. `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- `cost`: calculated based on token usage
- `result`: truncated summary of the response

## 🧠 Why This Matters

LLM calls are a core part of most agent workflows — but without visibility, it’s impossible to debug or optimize:

- Which call caused the failure?
- Which step was it part of?
- How much did it cost?
- What was the actual response?

This integration gives you full transparency, with **zero boilerplate**.

## 🧪 Example

```python
import lucidicai as lai
import openai

lai.init(
    session_name="chatbot_run",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    lucidic_api_key="your-api-key",
    provider="openai"
)

lai.create_step(state="Intro", goal="Ask user for name")

# This call is automatically tracked!
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's your name?"}]
)

lai.end_step(is_successful=True, action="Generated greeting")
```

## 🛠️ Notes

- Only `openai.ChatCompletion.create` is currently patched
- You must have an active session and step for events to be attached
- You can always override or add custom events using `create_event()` if needed
